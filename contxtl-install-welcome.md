# Welcome to the Fundamntls project.

While many are claiming that the digital realm is merging with our physical layer, we find the transition extremely painful. Drunk on Silicon propaganda, our western society seems to underestimate the gravity of the situation.

You are maybe on the verge of initating a new contxtl machine.
Maybe trying to ressurect one.
Or perhaps you want to clone it.

I sincerely hope you will have the smoothest ride possible (but not smoother); and that you will find your way.

Depending on your relationship with technology, you might benefit from leaving your preconcieved notions of what computers are for at the door.

Don't try to redo what you know, learn.

Observe.

Whatever you do, rember to have fun.
