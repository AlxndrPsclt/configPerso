# A high color adventure

## Into the woods

We'll paint one happy little tree right here. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.

There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. This is the fun part

## Serenity is near

Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. In this world, everything can be happy. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.

Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Take your time. Speed will come later.

Let's build an almighty mountain. Do an almighty painting with us. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy.

Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. Use what you see, don't plan it. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.

Only eight colors that you need. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart.
