# Ansible setup scripts

This is an ansible collection of setup scripts for a personal computer: laptop of desktop are curently in scope.

They are meant to be run on a clean arch-linux install.

First, you have to get the pre-install.sh script and run it on the destination machine. You the should edit the config files to match you desired system. 
Then, you can run the ansible playbook from the control machine, usingthe launch-setup.sh script.b. The destination machine can be the same the control machine; you just need to install ansible on the machine (will soon be added to generic install script).
